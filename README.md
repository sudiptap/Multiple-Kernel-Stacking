# Multiple-Kernel-Stacking
Mutiple Kernel Learning by Stacking
This is an attempt to perform Multiple Kernel Learning using well known ensemble method stacking. Its an work in progress. More to come in next couple of days.

How to Use
-----------
1. Install the dependencies first
2. Download iris dataset from the following weblink : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
3. Copy the dataset in the same directory as source code for smooth execution. Please adjust the input file path otherwise.
4. Run cross_validation_for_iris.py file.

I will soon update the jupyter notebook version of the code with better explanation and more comments.
